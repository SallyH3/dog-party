# dog-party
I started this project by building out the HTML and using semantic tags to create a clean structure for my page. I crafted my HTML according to the Turing HTML Style Guide.
I then styled my site using CSS and aimed to get it as visually close to the comp as possible. I crafted my CSS according to the Turing CSS Style Guide. 

**I completed the following extensions:**

**CSS**

I made my Dog Party site mobile with media queries. I changed the links in the nav bar to a hamburger icon upon mobile view. 
I positioned my columns vertically upon mobile view.


**Javascript**

I built functionality to allow the user to type a dog name in the input field and then, when the user clicks the button, have that dog name replace the text 'Some Dogs' in the main A Site About Some Dogs header and clear out the input field. 
I then crafted my Javascript according to the Turing Javascript Style Guide.
